As a first-time investor, I was unaware of the filing requirement until contacted by Interactive Brokers, my broker. They inquired about potential affiliation with EMCORE, which I denied, having no connection to the company.   Upon further research, I discovered the SEC reporting obligation. Despite my broker's notification, they did not provide clear guidance on the necessary actions.   This late filing results solely from my unfamiliarity with SEC regulations. I have taken immediate steps to rectify the situation and ensure future compliance.   I request consideration of this explanation and waiver of potential penalties.
