However, the Original Filing inadvertently omitted an additional 76.6 RF shares that are also attributable to the indirect beneficial ownership of the reporting person resulting from the direct ownership interest in the same limited partnership of a generation-skipping trust, of which the reporting person is a beneficiary and serves as trustee.  This Form 3/A is being filed to correctly reflect the reporting person's aggregate proportionate indirect ownership interest in the RF shares directly held by the limited partnership (427.9 RF shares).  Although the additional 76.6 RF shares were also omitted from four Forms 4 filed by the reporting person subsequent to the date of the Original Filing, there have been no transactions by the limited partnership in RF common stock since that time.",0001281761,RF-PF,,,2020-12-18
