On September 2, 2019, Takehiro Abe sold 1,800,000 shares of the Company's common stock to 34 investors at a fixed price of $0.03 per share. The sale was conducted under the Company's effective S-1 Registration Statement. Of the 34 investors, 4 were entities controlled by Mr. Abe. Each of these 4 entities purchased 20,000 shares.  On April 1, 2025, Mr. Abe entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with SKYPR LLC, an entity controlled by Ryohei Uetaki, under which he sold 18,200,000 shares of his restricted common stock in the Company for $80,000. These shares represent approximately 91% of the Company's outstanding stock. The transaction was completed on the same date and resulted in a change in control, with SKYPR LLC becoming the largest controlling stockholder.
